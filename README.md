# A Basic Weather App
Find my app [here](https://weather-app-3gi2fzysra-uc.a.run.app/).

In this project, I create a weather app with Flask to fetch display weather information provided by the OpenWeatherMap API. 
In this app, users can input their desired city or zipcode and the app will show the temperature and a short description of the current weather.
